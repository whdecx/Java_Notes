## Motivations / Purposes
- [[Interview planning]]

## Goals / Non-Goals
- Always remember to achieve your goals
- Don't spend too much time on non-goals or tangent topics
- Aim for a minimal viable product first

## Main Content
1. Why and when
    1. **Scope** 
    2. Where
    3. vertical and horizontal comparison
    4. "more effective to demonstrate experience by explaining 'when to use which' data structure"
2. **Concise** and **Complete**
3. Explain concepts
    - when to use which / Engineering -> trade-offs
    - Prove your experience instead recite facts
- Accurate and **structured** answers

### Answer template (AI Generated)
Start with a crisp, clear definition that shows you understand the core idea.
> “`<Concept>` is … It’s mainly used to …”

**Example:**  
> “A `Thread` in Java is a lightweight unit of execution that allows concurrent processing within a single program.”

---

## 2. Purpose / Motivation (Why do we need it?)
Explain *why this concept exists* or *what problem it solves*.
> “The main reason we use `<Concept>` is to … It helps achieve …”

**Example:**  
> “Threads are used to improve performance by executing multiple tasks simultaneously, especially when tasks involve waiting, such as I/O operations.”

---

## 3. Mechanism (How does it work?)
Describe the internal logic, process, or mechanism briefly and accurately.  
If it’s a language construct, describe *when* and *how* it’s triggered.
> “Under the hood, `<Concept>` works by … It involves …”

**Example:**  
> “Each thread runs independently, scheduled by the JVM using native OS threads. The `start()` method creates a new call stack, while `run()` defines the thread’s behavior.”

---

## 4. Example (How is it used?)
Provide a small code snippet or example to make your answer concrete.
```java
Thread t = new Thread(() -> {
    System.out.println("Running in another thread");
});
t.start();
```

---

## 5. Trade-offs / Limitations
Show critical thinking by mentioning drawbacks or caveats.
> “However, using `<Concept>` has limitations such as …”

**Example:**  
> “Thread creation has overhead, and shared data must be synchronized to avoid race conditions.”

---

## 6. Comparison / Related Concepts
Compare with similar or commonly confused concepts.
> “Compared to `<Related Concept>`, `<Concept>` is …”

**Example:**  
> “Unlike `Runnable`, which defines a task, `Thread` represents both the task and its execution context.”

---

## 7. Advanced Notes (Optional)
Add JVM-level, version-specific, or performance-related details if relevant.  
This distinguishes an intermediate from an advanced answer.
> “Since Java 8, `<change>` … or `JVM` handles `<mechanism>` by …”

**Example:**  
> “Since Java 8, the `ForkJoinPool` introduced a more efficient way to handle parallelism using the work-stealing algorithm.”

---

## 🧩 Summary
End with one clear sentence that ties everything together.
> “In short, `<Concept>` is essential for `<purpose>`, but it requires careful handling of `<trade-off>`.”

## ⚙️ Example Filled Answer

**Question:** What is a `HashMap` in Java?  

**Answer:**
> A `HashMap` is a data structure in Java that stores key–value pairs and provides constant-time average lookup using hash-based indexing.  
> It’s used to quickly store and retrieve data when keys are unique.  
> Internally, it uses an array of buckets where each bucket holds entries with the same hash code. Collisions are handled with linked lists or balanced trees (since Java 8).  
> Example:
> ```java
> Map<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
> map.put("apple", 2);
> map.put("banana", 5);
> ```
> However, it’s not synchronized and doesn’t maintain insertion order. Poorly implemented `hashCode()` or `equals()` methods can degrade performance.  
> Compared to a `TreeMap`, `HashMap` is faster but unsorted.  
> In short, `HashMap` is a fast, general-purpose key–value store ideal for non-concurrent access.
